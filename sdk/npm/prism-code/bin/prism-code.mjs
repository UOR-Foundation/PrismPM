Usage:
  prism-code run <app.holo> [--policy <file>] [--capabilities <file>] [--capability-set <name>] [--record <file>] [--port N] [--host H]
                                                    check the holo, then serve its view; POST /_hologram/intent
                                                    dispatches. A holo that fails check is refused (exit 1, 2 for
                                                    no verdict) unless --allow-unverified, which warns every start
  prism-code run <app.holo> <input> [--rm] [--policy <file>] [--allow-unverified] [--capabilities <file>] [--capability-set <name>]
  prism-code run <app.holo> --input <text> [--rm] ...
                                                    one run as a container: check the holo, dispatch the input, print
                                                    the output, exit with the container's code; --rm removes it on exit
  prism-code rm <container>...                      remove exited containers
  prism-code vectors <app.holo | closure-dir>       replay every acceptance vector through the guest
  prism-code history <app.holo | closure-dir> [--output <file>]
                                                    write the acceptance vectors as a history, the holo's first
  prism-code replay <history | dir>... --holo <app.holo | closure-dir> [--statement <file>] [--json]
                                                    re-execute histories against this build and compare every
                                                    outcome: exit 0 unchanged, 1 diverged, 2 could not replay

                                                    scaffold a project: prism.toml, a language-1.2 model and its
                                                    Lean workspace; --sdk-image also writes standards.lock and
                                                    prismpm.lock from that SDK image (needs Docker)
  prism-code manifest [<dir>] [--target <browser|node>] [--json]
                                                    check and lint prism.toml, with prism.<target>.toml merged;

  prism-code providers <up|down> [<dir>] [--target <browser|node>] [--json]
                                                    run the prism-provider-<type> each capability declares;

                                                    --type <uri> to check one predicate type, --json for the result
  prism-code export <NAME@sha256:DIGEST> [--out <dir> | --tar <file>] [--project <dir>] [--json]
                                                    write the six-file browser export of a verified release in
                                                    <project>/.prism/oci, or one tarball, with the holo's
                                                    attestations beside it; every byte is checked against
                                                    the build manifest
  prism-code generate <app.holo> --out <dir> [--lang js]
                                                    write bindings and a typed client from the holo's WIT world
                                                    and model into <dir>; writes nothing when nothing changed
  prism-code check <app.holo> [--policy <file>] [--json]
                                                    judge the holo against a policy and print its verdict:
                                                    exit 0 passed, 1 failed, 2 no verdict
  prism-code dev [<dir>] [--port <n>] [--no-open] [--policy <file>] [--build <command>] [--holo <path>]
                                                    watch the project, rebuild and re-check on every change, and

                                                    a referrer; a signer also signs a statement naming the manifest
  prism-code pull <reference> [<out.holo> | dir://store:tag] [--policy <file>] [--store <dir>]
                                                    fetch a holo and write it only after it verifies: digests, archive,
                                                    verdict, attestations; the verify-attestation flags add a signer policy

                      --signing-config <file>      a Sigstore signing configuration (a private instance); default is the public one
                      keyless signing takes its OIDC token from GitHub Actions (permission id-token: write) or SIGSTORE_ID_TOKEN
Options for verify-attestation:

                      --statement <file>           write the prism/replay/v1 statement there, also when it diverged

Options for history:  --output <file>              write there instead of stdout

                      --allow-unverified           run a holo that fails check, or a closure; prints a warning, never the default
                      --capabilities <file>        a prism/capabilities/1 file; without one the holo is granted nothing
                      --capability-set <name>      the set to apply, default "default"
                      --input <text>               the input of a one-shot run; the second argument is the same

                                                   the grant. Exit 1 when it denies, 2 when it cannot be evaluated
                      --replay <file>              a prism/replay/v1 statement to judge with the holo; unsigned, so it
                                                   can withhold P3 and never support it
                      --key <public.pem>           trust statements signed by this key; or name a keyless signer with

                                                   holo is P0: the provenance statement supports P1, the proof statement P2
                      --json                       the verdict as one canonical JSON object
                      --unstable-author            also prove the holo came from this project's spec
                      --project <dir>              with --unstable-author, the project; default the current directory
                      --reference <holo>           with --unstable-author, compare Core-Wasm, acceptance and the other sections
                      check needs a holo; to check a project's model, run build --check
Options for push:     --key <private.pem>          sign a statement naming the manifest, per predicate in the holo, for cosign verify-attestation
                      --keyless                    the same with an OIDC token, as attest does; --signing-config for a private instance
                      --no-attestations            push only the holo's manifest; the section stays in the file
Options for pull:     --policy <file>              the policy check reads; default: P0 or above, or PRISM_MINIMUM_LEVEL
                      --key <public.pem>, --certificate-identity <id>, --certificate-identity-regexp <re>, --certificate-oidc-issuer <url>
                                                   at least one attestation must pass this signer policy, as verify-attestation
                      --type <uri>, --trusted-root <file>, --entries <n>, --timestamps <n>
                                                   narrow or pin the signer policy, as verify-attestation
Options for both:     --store <dir>                the reference is a name in this local OCI layout; dir://<dir>[:tag] says the same
                      --plain-http                 reach a registry over HTTP; a loopback registry already is
                      --json                       the result as one canonical JSON object
                      references: registry/repo[:tag], registry/repo@sha256:<hex>, registry/repo@blake3:<fingerprint> (pull);
                      credentials come from Docker's config, or GHCR_TOKEN or GITHUB_TOKEN for ghcr.io

                      --json                       the merged manifest and the warnings as canonical JSON
Options for dev:      --port <n>                   the studio's port, default 4100; a port in use is an error, not a move
                      --no-open                    do not open the studio in a browser
                      --policy <file>              the policy the Check tab judges by, a file or a shipped name, as for check; an edit to a file re-checks
                      --build <command>            the build, in a shell; default [model].build of prism.toml, then prism-code build --update
                      --holo <path>                the file the build writes; default the one the build reports
Options for providers: --target <browser|node>     merge prism.browser.toml or prism.node.toml over prism.toml
                      --json                       the result as canonical JSON, with the values; text output never prints one
Options for build --unstable-author:
                      --author-command <path>      the agent process; default the bundled adapter, which needs @anthropic-ai/sdk
                      --author-model <id>          the model id to pin in prismpm.lock; default the lock's, then claude-opus-5-5
                      --author-timeout <seconds>   per attempt, default 600
                      --author-max-tokens <n>      stop after this many tokens across attempts, default 2000000
                      --max-iterations <n>         attempts before the build fails, default 10
Options for export:   --out <dir>                  a new directory name in the project, default export
                      --tar <file>                 a new <name>.tar in the project instead of a directory
                      --project <dir>              the project holding .prism/oci, default the current directory
                      --json                       print the prismpm/browser-export/1 receipt
Options for closures: --model <model.prism.json>   the model document (numeric-profile closures need it)
Options for setup:    --agent <id>                 configure only this agent and make it the preferred one: claude-code,
                                                   codex, cursor, vscode, claude-desktop, claude, chatgpt
                      --local                      also ready local builds: Docker (also inside WSL), the image, its cache;
                                                   without it setup needs no Docker, and apps build on GitHub Actions
                      --image <ref>                the SDK image to pull and cache, NAME@sha256:DIGEST; default the one
                                                   ./prismpm.lock pins; implies --local
                      --pull                       pull the image now, implies --local; without it the first build, verify
                                                   or axioms does
                      --no-pull                    the default: report a missing image instead of pulling it
                      --agents-only                skip the machine half: Node, line endings, GitHub and the local rows
                      --machine-only               only the machine half, local rows included; configure no agent and
                                                   register no handler
                      --json                       print the report as JSON
                      --dry-run                    print what it would write and run; change nothing
