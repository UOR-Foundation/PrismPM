/**
 * `prism.verify`: check, policy, attestations and replay as one namespace
 * (issue #449, design proposal #440). Every trust decision is meant to live in
 * this module, and in no other.
 *
 * Each member is the existing code under a Docker-SDK shaped name, so a verdict
 * from here equals the one `experimental_verify`, `check` and `@prism-code/verify`
 * return. The one rule this file adds is `withoutEvidence`. Nothing that exists is
 * renamed; that is #347. `createPrism` does not expose this yet; that is #441.
 *
 * P2 means the Lean kernel accepted the listed theorems about the model, not that
 * the shipped program is proven; `limits` names what such a verdict trusts.
 *
 * Nothing here imports Node at load, so `createPrism` can expose this in a
 * browser. `check.mjs` and `attest.mjs` read files and need `node:crypto`, so the
 * members over them load them on first use and refuse outside Node.
 *
 * Experimental until the v0.6 freeze (STABILITY.md section 6).
