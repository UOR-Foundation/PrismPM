/**
 * The draft form of `prism/spec/1`, and the step that completes it.
 *
 * A model's job is translation: it writes what the user said, which is a
 * `title`, the `fields`, the ordered `rules` and the `otherwise` answer.
 * Everything else a spec holds restates those or adds to them, so Prism derives
 * it here, the same way every time:
 *
 *   outcomes    the answers the rules and `otherwise` give, in first-appearance order
 *   purpose     one sentence built from the answers and the fields
 *   name        from the title, as the session derives it
 *   examples    the first request each rule decides, and one for `otherwise`
 *   properties  guarantees read off the rules, each marked as proposed
 *
 * A spec is a draft when it leaves out any of `purpose`, `outcomes`,
 * `properties` or `examples`. A stored spec holds all four (Prism writes them,
 * empty when there is nothing), so it is never completed again and a guarantee
 * the user struck does not come back. A draft is still `prism/spec/1`:
 * completing it gives an ordinary spec, and a spec that is already whole comes
 * back as `validateSpec` gives it.
 *
 * Pure: no clock, no randomness, no files. The same input gives the same spec,
 * and so the same canonical bytes and the same address.
