/**
 * @prism-code/testing: test a Prism application without a network or a clock.
 *
 * - `createMockHost`: a deterministic host with a clock that skips time, a seeded random source and
 *   capability-checked stubs for outbound hosts, key-value stores and variables.
 * - `scriptedDispatch`: a stand-in for `app.dispatch` that answers from a list and throws on an
 *   unexpected call; `assertComplete()` throws while calls remain.
 * - History fixtures in the `prism/history/1` format `prism-code replay` reads, through prism-code's
 *   own reader, writer and recorder: `readHistory`, `writeHistory`, `recordHistory`, `assertReplays`.
 * - `referenceArchive`: Calculator and Payment Approval with their recorded histories.
 *
 * Experimental until the v0.6 freeze (STABILITY.md section 6).
