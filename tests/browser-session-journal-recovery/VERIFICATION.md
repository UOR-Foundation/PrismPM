# Private recovery component

Full DK-30 and public Browser admission remain unaccepted. Authentication,
freshness and journal composition remain required separately; the following is
component evidence only.

## Complete source-component run

2026-09-27, pinned devcontainer, fresh private owner: **PASS, 4,277.633 s**.
All 3,135 vectors (1,064 context, 1,035 recovery, 895 Session, 141 metadata),
64 exact/one-over maxima and 24 actual compiled source mutants passed with
native std/no_std and independently generated Wasm. Limits remain 512 steps,
1,024 replay records, 64 MiB frames, 64 KiB stack and 1 GiB Wasm memory.
No skipped, cancelled or todo cases. All 833 frozen inputs were rechecked.

This receipt verifies source behavior, compiler reuse, generated-package
provenance and native executable identity. Its Wasm substitution check covers
the maximum-runner copy only: original Cargo artifacts and exposed execution
buffers are not rechecked by this revision. Shared artifact-identity guards
and a fresh complete changed-closure run remain required; this result must not
be represented as complete artifact provenance or application acceptance.

The private compiler performed 288 guarded invocations. Its nine real reuse
adversaries rejected changed tools, compiler sources/libraries, added files,
cloned authority and altered input identities before execution. Guarded cache
retirement completed after evidence publication; closed-owner reuse, execution
and double retirement were rejected. Source, proofs, IR and products remain.

Two interrupted diagnostic runs passed the vectors and maxima; the later run
also detected five mutants, but neither completed the owner. Their logs are
`target/recovery-verification/run-9xuwgXz7/owner.log` and
`target/recovery-verification/run-NWkdOvNp/owner.log`.
The first private-reuse run, `run-Zr6Gf4jb`, also passed the vectors/maxima
and two mutants before a controlled stop. Its mutant intervals were 176.7 s
and 191.7 s, projecting beyond the previous 58-minute owner limit.

The completed run reused one freshly built private compiler, never an ambient
cache. Captured source, executable, launcher and toolchain identities are
checked before and after use. All 25 source/kernel/IR/native/Wasm product
builds remain fresh. Generated-package manifests are frozen before compilation;
actual substitutions must be rejected. Complete evidence precedes tool-cache
retirement, and a separate completion receipt binds both.
Full import/pin closure is parsed at each product boundary. Every invocation
still rechecks all captured bytes, file types and link counts; identical source
bytes cannot change imports. This avoids measured 952–1,252 ms repeated graph
parsing (the equivalent 833-file byte check took 45–54 ms). A 90-minute owner
and 92-minute process deadline cover the measured complete workload without
dropping cases. Per-invocation guard/build timings remain in the receipt/log.

## Historical component evidence

2026-09-27, pinned devcontainer, fresh generated owner: 175.608 s, PASS.
Actual source/kernel/axiom replay and LCNF produced native std/no_std and two
independent identical Wasm packages for each of four roots. All 30 context,
30 recovery, 895 unchanged Session and 107 metadata vectors passed twice.
The 827 captured input hashes were independently rechecked after completion.
