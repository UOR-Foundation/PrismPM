# ST-17 PKCE S256

The complete registered component owner passed on 28 September 2026: 19
mandatory checks, no skips, 731.97 seconds. The source-defined verifier and
base64url operations compile through the pinned LexLean/lean4-prod toolchain;
the private browser adapter supplies actual CSPRNG and SHA-256 operations.

The complete RFC 7636 text is retained under `oracles/`, including its license.
The independent corpus reads its Appendix B values and enumerates 33,930 cases:
all verifier lengths and octets/positions, entropy bits, and operation tags.
Every case executes twice in native std/no_std, Node Wasm, and each pinned
Chromium, Firefox and WebKit engine. Peak Wasm memory is 131,072 bytes.

Each browser additionally records 185 actual adapter calls, replayed twice in
both native modes. Corrupted transcripts fail. Five freshly compiled source
defects and four host defects in all three engines fail their named behavioral
checks. Real provider failures, shared/detached inputs, caller-buffer changes
and revocation during asynchronous cryptography are covered.

Evidence in container `prismpm-pkce-owner`,
`/tmp/prismpm-pkce-87FfXR/owner.json`:

- Receipt: `e3f3969ebc4af9261d0a1c218389869ab39d1b211fe2660602d59361afa37506`.
- Kernel attestation: `3dc7741d9df6e15dd2015bb28b58e19d57e4e70ac6b35dc8b26eabe2090a7f68`.
- Frozen source/tool closure: 836 files, rechecked before acceptance.
- Original/private compiler, generated-package and Wasm substitutions refuse.
- SDK registration, omission/deadline and compiler-handle checks: 35 passed.

Earlier runs failed on a missing test-family registration and an invalid source
mutant; neither is accepted. The final run includes corrected, kernel-verified
mutants. Broad infrastructure validation in the network-isolated Ubuntu SDK
remains RED for its missing Docker socket/bootstrap runtime and an OS-specific
filesystem race fixture; this component result is not full repository CI.

This is not mailbox verification, OAuth transaction admission, account recovery,
an accepted SDK release or a Foundry deployment. Their complete integration and
release gates remain mandatory; `PP2011` is unchanged. JavaScript buffer clearing
is best effort, not a guarantee that browser/provider memory contains no copies.
