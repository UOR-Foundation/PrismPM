description: Test code that dispatches into a holo with a mock host, a clock that skips time, scripted dispatch and recorded histories.
available_in: "0.6"

This guide shows you how to test the code around a holo without a network, a real clock or a running guest: a mock host, a clock that skips time, a dispatch that follows a script, and histories you record and replay.

`@prism-code/testing` is experimental. Pin the exact version if you use it. It takes `prism-code` as a peer dependency and uses its history reader, writer and recorder, so a history it writes is the file `prism-code replay` reads.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @prism-code/testing prism-code
```

## A mock host

A guest that targets the core-wasm world imports nothing, so the host is what surrounds a dispatch: the time it happens at, the random numbers your code draws, and the resources a capability file grants. `createMockHost` makes all three deterministic.

- `clock` starts at 2026-01-01T00:00:00Z unless you pass `start`, and moves only when you move it.
- `random` is seeded, so the same `seed` gives the same numbers on every platform.
- `fetch`, `kv` and `variable` check the same grant `load` enforces. With no capability file nothing is granted, so a missing grant fails in a test the way it fails in production. A granted URL with no stub in `fetch` is an `UnexpectedCallError`.
- `calls` lists every host call with the clock time it happened at.

`until(work)` is the time-skipping call. Each time the work is waiting and nothing else can proceed, it moves the clock to the next timer, so a minute of sleeping takes no real time. It rejects with `TestSetupError` when the work is still waiting and no timer is left, which means something other than the clock is awaited. `advance(ms)`, `next()` and `runAll()` give finer control: `advance` fires the timers that fall due, in order, with the clock at each one's time.

`host.load(source)` opens a holo with the host's capability file and set, from bytes or a path, so what the test grants is what `app.capabilities` reports.

## Scripted dispatch

`scriptedDispatch(script)` stands in for `app.dispatch`. The script lists the calls you expect, in order, each with a response or an error. A request is text or bytes, or a function of the received bytes that returns true. A response is text, bytes, or a function of the received bytes. An error is an `Error` to throw or a stable error code, thrown as a `PrismCodeError` the way a failed dispatch is.

A call that is not the next one listed throws `UnexpectedCallError`, naming the index and both requests, and leaves the script where it was. `assertComplete()` throws `ScriptIncompleteError` while listed calls have not happened, so a test that forgets a call fails.

{{example:testing-script}}

A `prism/history/1` is also a script: `scriptedDispatch(history)` answers the recorded requests with the recorded responses and refusals.

## Histories

A history is the dispatches of one application in order with their recorded outcomes. The package reads and writes the format with prism-code's own code.

| Call | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `readHistory(path)` | Reads and validates a history file. A file the schema rejects is a `ReplayError`. |
| `writeHistory(path, history)` | Writes canonical JSON and one line feed, the bytes `prism-code history` writes. |
| `recordHistory(app, run)` | Passes `run` a `dispatch` that records every outcome, refusals included, and resolves to the history. |
| `assertReplays(app, histories)` | Replays against the build and rejects with `DeterminismViolationError` on a divergence. |
| `referenceArchive(name)` | Calculator or Payment Approval with its committed history. |

{{example:testing-history}}

Payment Approval is in the repository's fixtures and not in the npm package, so `referenceArchive('PaymentApproval')` works in a checkout and `referenceArchives()` lists what your install has. Pass `{ directory }` to read fixtures from somewhere else.

Commit a recorded history next to your holo and replay it in CI. A change to the model that alters an answer then fails the test, which is what the replay gate in [Rebuild and update](/docs/guides/rebuild-and-update) does on the command line.
