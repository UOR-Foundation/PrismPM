# Developer view glossary

The developer view of #346: the words of the `prism-code` CLI, its SDK namespaces and their developer docs, each mapped onto the canonical term of the model, which does not change.
Generated from `bindings/src/Foundation/Views/V1/Developer.lex.tex` by `cargo xtask check-developer-view --write`; edit the model, not this file.

A Docker word is used only for its Docker meaning. Where Docker has a behaviour Prism lacks, the word waits for the issue that builds it.
