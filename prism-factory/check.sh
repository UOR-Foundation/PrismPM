#  2. When the pinned Lean is present, the model is verified through the kernel
#     and re-exported, and the export must equal the committed bundle.
#  3. The host's tests pass and both committed workflows equal their projection:
#     factory.yml, and release.yml with its job fragments (prism-factory/jobs/).
# It runs in a directory that holds only this obligation's declared inputs.
