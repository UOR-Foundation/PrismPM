//! The release of a server application, verified and replayed without its source.
//!
//! A release carries the files of the build, among them the consumer's workspace
//! (`consumer/`) and the packages of the core and of the host (`server/`), and the
//! evidence of `prismpm verify`. This module checks that evidence against the
//! released files alone ([`check`]) and replays the acceptance by rebuilding the
//! released program and answering every vector with it ([`replay`]).
//!
//! The check is the one release assembly and every later replay of the release
//! graph make (`crate::release_verification`): it derives the acceptance document
//! from the model and the released files and requires the retained one to be it.
//! The replay adds what only a run can show: the program built from the released
//! files, under the build bound the model declares, answers every acceptance
//! vector over every transport and every served vector over a loopback socket as
//! the model says, and its record is the retained one.
