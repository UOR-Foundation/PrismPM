//! The retained verification of a server application, derived again from the
//! released files.
//!
//! A server application has no View, guest or archive. What its verification
//! establishes is that the program built from the release's files is accepted, so
//! what a release must show is the acceptance document that
//! `crate::server_verification::document` derives from the model and those files,
//! with the record of the acceptance the model determines. Nothing here runs a
//! process: the packages, the consumer's workspace and the declared bounds are
//! checked against the model, and the document the verification retained must be
//! the document derived from them.
