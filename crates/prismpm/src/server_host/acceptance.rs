//! Acceptance of a built host program against the modeled exchange corpus.
//!
//! Every acceptance vector is executed through the program's `exchange`
//! command with the vector's transcript as the host script, once over a request
//! file and once over standard input. The response must be byte-identical to the
//! modeled one, the program must exit zero, and every transcript step must be
//! replayed. The record names each declared effect with the number of steps
//! that exercised it, so an effect no vector reaches cannot be reported verified.
//!
//! When the caller links a deterministic binding, every vector is also run
//! through the program's `run` command, which performs the effects through the
//! declared binding with no script: the response must be the modeled one again.
//!
//! The record states what reached each declared effect, as the run observed it:
//! a core effect is reached by the steps of the transcripts the program replayed
//! to the end (a script with a step left over is refused by the program), a
//! frame effect by the served exchanges, each of which builds the whole request
//! frame. An effect nothing reached is `PP2021`, never a verified application.
//!
//! A served application is also run as a server: for every served vector the
//! program is started with `serve` on its declared loopback listener, the
//! vector's HTTP request is sent over a TCP connection, and the bytes read until
//! the connection closes must be the vector's response exactly. A fresh program
//! serves each vector, so the host state a vector sees does not depend on the
//! vectors before it.
