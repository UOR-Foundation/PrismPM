//! Build of a server application: the declared core through LexLean's
//! `production` API, and the generated host adapter laid out around it.
//!
//! The core is a LexLean production root whose export is `run(Bytes) ->
//! Result<List<u64>, Overflow>`. The compiler certifies it (preservation
//! certificates A, B and E, replayed by Lean's kernel); this module only names
//! the root, the package and the one target, `rust-std`, and refuses what the
//! adapter cannot run: a root the project does not declare as a production root,
//! a package that exhibits an effect the adapter gives no bound for, a project
//! that changed while it was exported.
//!
//! The result is a set of files relative to the consumer's Cargo workspace root:
//! the core package under its crate name, and the two generated packages of the
//! host adapter. The workspace manifest, the binding crate and the release
//! profile stay the consumer's own (`server_host::workspace::verify`), and the
//! build retains them beside the packages ([`consumer_artifacts`]), so that a
//! release holds everything its program is built from.
